# Automated Spray Control Based on Severity Level for Tomato Plants using Deep Learning and Image Processing

## Overview
The rapid and accurate identification of plant diseases is crucial for maintaining crop health and agricultural productivity. Traditional methods are often manual, time-consuming, and prone to errors. In recent years, advancements in machine vision technology, particularly leveraging deep learning and image processing techniques, have shown promise in addressing these challenges.

This repository contains code and resources for an end-to-end system designed to automate the detection and severity estimation of diseases in tomato plants. Our approach combines state-of-the-art deep learning models with image processing algorithms to analyze digital images of tomato leaves. This allows for not only detecting the presence of disease but also quantifying its severity.

## Key Features
- **Automated Disease Detection:** Utilizes deep learning models for accurate identification of disease presence in tomato plants.
- **Severity Estimation:** Provides quantitative assessment of disease severity, crucial for effective disease management strategies.
- **Integration with Agricultural Practices:** Designed to be integrated into existing agricultural workflows, facilitating informed decision-making and optimized treatment plans.
- **Cost Savings:** Enables significant reduction in pesticide usage by precisely measuring disease severity and implementing targeted treatment strategies.

## Repository Structure
- **`Disease Detection/`**: Contains dataset for training and implementation of the deep learning models for Disease Detection in Tomato Plants.
